## Basic Cider

This is a template recipe for basic hard cider.

### Prerequisites/Knowledge

* Follow proper [sanitization](../techniques/sanitization.md) procedures. Requires additional materials.
* Bottling not covered in this document.

### Ingredients
* Bread yeast (or any brewing yeast), 1 packet
* Apple cider, 1 to 5 gallons
    * Ensure there is no chemical preservatives in the cider, this can kill the yeast growth.
    * For reference, I use Wegmans basic apple cider. I am currently looking for cheaper apple juice alternatives for off-season brewing.

### Materials
* Brewing container, 1 to 5 gallons, foodsafe.
* Stopper for the brewing container
* Fermentation lock

### Instructions
1. Proof the brewing yeast
    * Add two tablespoons of sugar to a cup of water at 110&deg;F.
    * Sprinkle the yeast packet onto the mixture, give a slight stir
    * Wait 10 minutes, you should see foamy mixture on top. If true, continue to next step. If false, restart proofing with new packet of yeast.
2. Prepare the brew
    * Fill the brewing container with freshly opened cider
    * Pour the yeast proof mixture on top
    * Apply stopper and fermentation lock

3. Follow the [primary ferment](../techniques/primary_ferment.md) process.
4. Follow the [bottling](../techniques/bottling.md) process, carbonation option.
