### Siphoning

This is a subsection describing the siphoning procedure in brewing. When using brewing containers with a small opening in the top, it is necessary to siphon the brew into a separate container for bottling.

## Materials

* Auto-siphon

## Cleaning the auto siphon

Cleaning the auto-siphon is easy but can be annoying in a small sink setting. I prefer to first wash the outside of the siphon components.

1. Remove the inner shaft of the siphon.
2. Wash the outside of the inner and outer shaft of the siphon
3. Fill a mixing bowl with soap and water, mix thoroughly.
4. Siphon the soapy water into the sink, washing the inside of the siphoning tube
5. Rinse all components

## Using the auto siphon

1. Ensure the bottling container is lower in altitude than the brewing container
1. It is recommended to use clips to fasten the siphon shaft at a fixed depth into the brewing container, and to fasten the siphon output hose to the edge of the bottling container.
2. Pump the siphon two to three times.
3. Watch the hydraulics at play!
