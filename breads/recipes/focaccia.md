## Foccacia

This is a template recipe for basic foccacia bread.

### Ingredients

* Water, 2 cups
* Active dry yeast, 1 package
* All purpose flour, 4.5 cups
* White sugar, 2.25 tsp
* Salt, 2 tsp
* Garlic powder, 0.5 tsp
* Rosemary leaves, 0.5 tsp
* Olive oil, 2 tsp
* Coarse sea salt, 1 tbsp

### Instructions

1. Mix 2 cups warm water and active dry yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer until foamy. 
2. Add the flour, sugar, salt, garlic, rosemary, and olive oil and knead for 5-8 minutes, until the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl.
4. Oil a large bowl with a generous amount of olive oil, add dough ball and cover with a plastic cloth. Let rise until doubled in size, 1 hour - 1 hour and 15 minutes, depending on room temp after dough has doubled in size, punch down to release gases. 
5. Generously oil half sheet pan with olive oil. Press out dough evenly to the sides of the pan. Sprinkle olive halves across bread, pressing down slightly. 
6. Cover with plastic and a cloth and let rise an additional 45 minutes to 1 hour. 
7. After the second rise, uncover focaccia and poke with fingers/ knuckles to create dimples. 
8. Sprinkle coarse sea salt over dough and drizzle with more olive oil and bake at 375Â°F for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown.
