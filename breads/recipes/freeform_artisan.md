## Freeform Artisan

This is a recipe for artisan bread recommended by my mother in law. She got this from an old cookbook. This recipe makes multiple loafs and is easily scalable. Takes a day (mostly fridge time).

### Ingredients

1. Water, 3 cups
2. Granulated yeast, 1.5 tbsp or 2 packets
3. Kosher or other type of coarse salt, 1.5 tbsp
4. Unsifted, unbleached, all-purpose white flour, exactly 6.5 cups
5. (Opt) Cornmeal for more complex crust

### Materials

1. Oven
2. Large mixing bowl
3. Saran wrap or covering for the mixing bowl while dough rises and keeps

### Instructions

1. Warm the water slightly, slightly above room temperature, to about 100&deg;F. Configures rising time to about 2 hours. Using cold tap water will configure a rising time of 3 to 4 hours. Take note of this rising time for later in this procedure.

2. Add yeast and salt to the water inside the mixing bowl.

3. Mix in all of the flour at once, kneading is unnecessary. Not sure why, just copying this down bro. Use a wooden spoon for maximum effect. You could use a high capacity food processor, but where is the fun in that? Mixing is complete when everything is uniformly moist.

4. Allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until the dough flattens out or collapses under its own weight. Base rising time on step 1. Allowing to rise for longer will not harm the end product.

5. STORAGE: Best results involve letting dough sit in the fridge overnight, because the cooler dough is easier to handle. Also, there are flavor impacts to letting the dough cool in the fridge.

6. When ready to bake, sprinkle flour on the dough, and cut off a one-pound section for baking (roughly grapefruit size).

7. Make a gluten cloak around the bread, which is just shaping the dough. Sprinkle more flour on the section of dough. Quickly pull the section of dough around itself to the bottom of the piece, forming a tight ball, with a ragged bottom where the folds meet.
